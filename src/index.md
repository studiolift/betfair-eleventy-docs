### An important note on publishing

Updating articles is a straight-forward process, simply using the 'update' or 'publish' buttons should be enough when editing or creating an entry. When changing other aspects of the site you might be prompted to republish the site using the below dialogue box.

<div class="warning">
  <h3>Warning</h3>
  <p>Please <strong>avoid</strong> publishing all files. Instead, if you need to publish changes it is better practice to publish 'Only Indexes' instead. Publishing the all files could cause a large queue to form in larger blogs as it will republish every single entry.</p>
